## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

```
main branch (production-ready)
├── develop branch (integration)
    ├── feature/US-001-task-project-relationship
    ├── feature/US-002-task-assignment
    ├── hotfix/critical-security-fix
    └── release/v1.0.0
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**

- `feature/US-###-short-description`
- `bugfix/issue-number-description`
- `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- `release/version-number`

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Feature Branch** from `develop`
2. **Implement Feature** with tests and documentation
3. **Self-Review** code before creating PR
4. **Create Pull Request** with detailed description
5. **Code Review** by assigned reviewers
6. **Address Feedback** and update PR
7. **Approval & Merge** to develop branch

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Feature implementation complete
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance impact assessed

- 3 points: Standard feature implementation
- 5 points: Complex feature requiring research
- 8 points: Large feature spanning multiple areas
- 13 points: Epic that should be broken down

## Quality Assurance Process

### Testing Strategy

**Test Pyramid Structure:**

- 70% Unit Tests (models, utils, business logic)
- 20% Integration Tests (API endpoints, database)
- 10% End-to-End Tests (complete user workflows)

### Automated Testing

**Pre-commit Hooks:**

- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Linting (ruff)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Basic test suite

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

```yaml
1. Code Quality Checks
├── Linting and formatting
├── Security scanning
└── Dependency vulnerability check

2. Test Execution
├── Unit tests
├── Integration tests
└── Performance tests

3. Build and Deploy
├── Docker image building
├── Staging deployment
└── Production deployment (manual approval)
```

### Performance Standards

**API Response Times:**

- 95% of requests < 200ms
- 99% of requests < 500ms
- AI-powered endpoints < 2 seconds

**Database Performance:**

- Query execution time < 100ms
- Connection pool efficiency > 90%
- Zero N+1 query patterns

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**AI Service Dependency:**

- _Risk_: OpenAI API rate limits or downtime
- _Mitigation_: Implement caching, fallback mechanisms, and alternative providers

**Database Performance:**

- _Risk_: Slow queries affecting user experience
- _Mitigation_: Regular performance monitoring, query optimization, and indexing

**Security Vulnerabilities:**

- _Risk_: Data breaches or unauthorized access
- _Mitigation_: Regular security audits, penetration testing, and compliance reviews

### Process Risks

**Team Velocity:**

- _Risk_: Sprint commitments not met
- _Mitigation_: Conservative estimation, regular velocity tracking, and scope adjustment

**Code Quality:**

- _Risk_: Technical debt accumulation
- _Mitigation_: Strict code review process, refactoring sprints, and quality metrics

**Knowledge Transfer:**

- _Risk_: Key team member unavailability
- _Mitigation_: Documentation requirements, code sharing, and cross-training
